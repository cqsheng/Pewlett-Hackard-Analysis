# An Analysis of Pewlett Hackard

## Overview of Project
    This project is used to determine the number of employees who will soon be retiring and help implement measures to ensure a smooth transition.
### Purpose
    The purpose is to determine how many employees are in the age range for retirement, create a list of all those employees names and job titles, and a summary of the number of employees retiring for each different job title. Another list is also created to determine the employees who are eligible for the mentorship program based on their age.

## Results
    Various election outcomes will be addressed here, and a picture from the text file with the results produced will accompany it. The results are located in election_analysis.txt in the analysis folder.

## Summary
    The analysis was effective at providing the results for this election and can be modified to be used for any election.
### 1.Expanding the code to analyze multiple election audits:
    Currently the code can only analyze one file containing votes that must be pre entered into the code itself. The code can be changed to take user input on which files to run the analysis for and output the results for multiple files over and over again until prompted by the user to stop.
### 2.Take into account of political parties:
    To bulid onto the last proposed change, if the files also contained the political parties the candidates were assoicated with. The winning party for each county can also be determined, and in the case with multiple files the parties could be tracked from file to file to determine the overall winning party that won the most counties.
